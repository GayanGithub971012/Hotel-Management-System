# Hotel-Management-System
The completed system developed using C# ASP.net programming Language. The North Breeze Ezy hotel management system is developed in order to maintain the customer’s details and where customers can do all the reservations online. I developed an application that could be used by ‘Hotel Northern Breeze’ in order to aid their room booking procedures. In this hotel 25 modern furnished rooms are available. All bookings are taken on a 'room-only basis, guests pay for their meals in the restaurant. The hotel has three sizes of rooms: single, double, triple family; in addition, each room may be of different categories: standard or deluxe. Executive suite and Royal suite, furnished in elegant style with the addition of all modern international standard facilities.
